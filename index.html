      <h4>
        <strong>Mangú</strong> is made up of boiled green plantains with or
        without peel on. When cooked through and soft the peel is removed.
        Plantains are then mashed with a fork and some water in which they were
        boiled. The goal is to mash plantains until smooth with some to no
        lumps. The dish is topped with sautéed red onions that have been cooked
        with vinegar and oil.
