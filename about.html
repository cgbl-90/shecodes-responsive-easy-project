      <h1>Mangu History</h1>
      <h4>
        Like the African fufu and Puerto Rican mofongo, the Ecuadorian bolón de
        verde and other similar dishes, the mangú is a version of the West
        African fufu.
        <br />
        It arrived in the Caribbean with the slaves of ewe, fon, wolof, ashanti,
        Yoruba or dinka origin. In Africa, this dish is made mainly with tubers,
        mainly cassava and yams, cooked and then crushed in a large mortar until
        a paste is obtained, fufu, which is usually served accompanied by a fish
        soup, tomato and ground peanut.
        <br />
        Among the West African slaves employed in the plantations of the
        Caribbean and the north Pacific of South America, this dish began to be
        made with cooked bananas, reserving the tubers for more substantial
        meals such as sancocho, while it used to be accompanied by the leftovers
        of the white masters.
        <br />
        With the emancipation of the black slaves, leftovers were replaced by
        meat ingredients - such as cold cuts or dried meat -, cheese and fried
        eggs; due to its simplicity and its high nutritional value, this dish
        transcended racial and social barriers, becoming a very popular meal for
        all social classes.
        <br />
        According to a popular legend, the word "mangú" comes from the time of
        the first American invasion (1916-1924) to the Dominican Republic; when
        tasting this mashed bananas, they expressed: "Man, (this is) good!",
        (man, this is good!) and the Dominicans, not mastering English, took the
        expression to name this dish and continued to use the term. But this is
        something of which there is no evidence and it is more a folk tale. It
        is much more likely that the word is a variation of the word "mangusi",
        a name used in some parts of Congo for any tuber that is boiled and
        consumed in mashed form
